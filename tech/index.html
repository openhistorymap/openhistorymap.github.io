This creates a larger indirection on our side, but it enables us to look a the world in a different way, considering also not just what is real now that comes from a psat, but bringing the whole OSM premise (every data point has to be verifiable&mldr;) into the past (&mldr; not just today but &ldquo;yesteday&rsquo;s today&rdquo;). Open Street Map can be a source for data for our Oen History Map project, obviously, as many archaeological areas are visible today and were living cities in the past, and at the same time WikiData identifiers are the &ldquo;connection points&rdquo; for OHM to interact with other projects and other datasets available on-line.</p></div><a href=/tech/diifferences/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="bg-gray bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/><img alt="Licenza Creative Commons" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png></a>
