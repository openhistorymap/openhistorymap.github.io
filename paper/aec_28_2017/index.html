OpenHistoryMap aspires to become the open source geographical system for archaeological information, both from an academic and an educational point of view. There are many fragmented online web-GIS experiences targeted at very specific projects, but no tool enables a broader overview of both research and studies. For these reasons, in order to create an Open Access platform, one of the most important aspects is the creation of tools that can facilitate both the sharing of archaeological spatial and temporal information as well as the easy reuse of the generated data. OpenHistoryMap is supposed to create a tool that is both a map of the archaeological world as well as a repository for the connected data within structured research papers. The project finds its roots first of all within the collective experience of &lsquo;archaeology&rsquo; that refers to non-expert users, and in the second place within the academic scientific experience of research centres and universities. While the first approach gives an integrated and reliable picture of the cultural item, the second provides consistent and solid datasets with a perspective on the mixture of specific types of information."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.147.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://openhistorymap.github.io/paper/aec_28_2017/><meta property="og:url" content="https://openhistorymap.github.io/paper/aec_28_2017/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Open History Map"><meta property="og:title" content="Open History Map"><meta property="og:description" content="Abstract: OpenHistoryMap aspires to become the open source geographical system for archaeological information, both from an academic and an educational point of view.
