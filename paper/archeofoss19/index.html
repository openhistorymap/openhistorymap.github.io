The paper proposed herein presents three events organized in 2018 and tries to find a common thread through these experiences. Two of these events were organized thanks to the collaboration between Trentino Alto Adige Wiki and Arc-Team, while the third was conceived and organized by Open History Map, an association based in Bologna. The three events deal with very different topics but have in common the close collaboration between the public, Wikimedia volunteers and researchers."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.147.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://openhistorymap.github.io/paper/archeofoss19/><meta property="og:url" content="https://openhistorymap.github.io/paper/archeofoss19/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Open History Map"><meta property="og:title" content="Participatory Models in Archaeology: Wiki and Open Access Platforms"><meta property="og:description" content="Abstract: The paper proposed herein presents three events organized in 2018 and tries to find a common thread through these experiences.
