Open History Map (https://www.openhistorymap.org) is a non-profit based in Bologna, Italy, aiming at the creation of an open map of the past, reconciling and interconnecting data from Digital Humanities, Public History and Digital Archaeology sources. The presentation will cover the philosophy, the technology and the libraries used in this endeavor, explaining how users can reuse, and integrate the data from the platform into their applications or visualizations.
