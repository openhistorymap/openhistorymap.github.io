# Abstract:
Internet presence and applications are central for modern museums and cultural institutions. Even more it is important to facilitate and standardize the user experience in order to create a standard quality level and, for the institutions, it is important to simplify configuration operations bound to the creation of the visualized elements and the explorations of the spaces. This demo covers both the technologies underneath the GeoContext tool and the CHContext visualization generator as well as the possible targets and applications. The final elements will cover possible enhancements already in the works.
