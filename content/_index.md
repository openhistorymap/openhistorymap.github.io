OpenHistoryMap is an italian non profit association (APS) founded by a team of archaeologists and software developers based in Bologna, Italy. The aim is the creation of a web-GIS platform containing spatial historical and archaeological data. OHM is an open source project using open source tools.

Technology and academia are the main sources of data, but end users can contribute as well, by sharing their datasets and by exploring the map and the data filtered by their queries.
