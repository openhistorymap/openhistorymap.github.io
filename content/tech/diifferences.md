## Difference with Open Historical Map (OSM's own attempt)
The main difference is in the premise: OSM contains data that is verifiable today, while our approach requires data to be verified by researchers. This creates a larger indirection on our side, but it enables us to look a the world in a different way, considering also not just what is real now that comes from a psat, but bringing the whole OSM premise (every data point has to be verifiable...) into the past (... not just today but "yesteday's today"). Open Street Map can be a source for data for our Oen History Map project, obviously, as many archaeological areas are visible today and were living cities in the past, and at the same time WikiData identifiers are the "connection points" for OHM to interact with other projects and other datasets available on-line.
