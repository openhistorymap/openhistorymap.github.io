# Open History Map

OpenHistoryMap is a non profit association with the ambitious aim to connect archaeology and neocartography making history available and usable by anyone.

Modern archaeological research is a hot topic, a sequence of major and minor discoveries changing the complex historical puzzle of our past.

Understading the historical processes, necessitating the passage through sythesis and the study of an enormous quantity of data requires way longer than usual archaeological data analysis.

OpenHistoryMap tries to close this gap even by a little, giving anybody the possibility to look at the data and experience published archaeological and historical data.
